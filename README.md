# SpaceInvaders

The first compulsory assignment we had that was related to UE4. 
The requirements were something that resembled the original Space Invaders, but I took it a step further

- Two game modes
  - Normal
    - 10 waves + boss
  - Endless
    - Every 10 waves there is a boss.
    - Online leadersboards (top 5 is visible in game, the rest here: https://mickydbros.no/prophet/spaceinvaders/highscores.php

Only one boss implemented, but I thought it was pretty cool back then.

The game is available on my itch:
spacedance.itch.io
